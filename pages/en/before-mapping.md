# Before Mapping 
Want to create your own BandSpace beatmaps? Let's prepare the following first.

## **A computer**
To run the BandSpace Editor, you will need a computer running either Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## **Install Beatmap Editor**
Please click the "Download" button above, or click [Here](https://github.com/Smartmelon/BandSpace/releases) to navigate to the releases page.

## **Songs**
### Choose a suitable song
A good beatmap can't be separated from excellent music. In theory, any song you like can be used for designing maps. However, since BandSpace is an VR rhythm game that involves playing instruments, for a good gaming experience it is recommended that you choose songs where at least one instrument stands out audibly.  

### Provide your File of Song
Once confirming your song choice, provide a suitable audio file format which will be imported into editor.  
Note: It requires file format ends with **.ogg**.  
If there are no available **.ogg** audio file which is demanded by editor mode in official game for working properly. You could also convert other types of audio files into **.ogg** type comfortably.  
There are many software available to do this task like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [FormatFactory](http://www.pcgeshi.com/index.html).  

Once preparing these demands ahead , follow [Mapping Instruction](mapping-instruction) then start designing freely on it.
