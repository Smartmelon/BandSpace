# MIDI Beatmap Generation

## **What are MIDI files**
MIDI files are sheet music information files that include database of various kinds of instruments, types and lengths of notes, pitch and other musical parameters required for performing a song. By importing MIDI file, we will automatically generate a beatmap for you which you can further adjust and modify as per your preferences.  

You can find and download MIDI files from websites like [BitMidi](https://bitmidi.com/) or [midiworld](https://www.midiworld.com/), or make your own with music editing softwares like [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) or [Musescore](https://musescore.com/).

## **Creating a New MIDI Generation**
When you have a MIDI file that matches with the audio file, we can begin.  
Open the **MIDI Generations** tab in the list of songs, all maps generated through MIDI will be displayed under this tab.  
Click on the **New MIDI Generation** button on this page to create a new beatmap through MIDI generation.

## **Importing MIDI**
Please complete the basic information of the beatmap first, as well as the importation of audio files, etc.  
After importing an audio file, you can click on the **Import MIDI** button to find and import your prepared MIDI file.   
Only a MIDI file that matches with a song can generate a game beatmap that matches with it.  
After successfully importing your MIDI file, you will be automatically redirected to the page for assigning midi tracks.

## **Assigning MIDI Tracks**
**MIDI Tracks** section will display all tracks contained within the imported MIDI file. On the right of each track, there are four instrument toggle buttons, each representing the drums, keyboard, bass and guitar that can be played in BandSpace.  
Highlighting an instrument button on a track will assign the MIDI notes contained in that track to a beatmap for that instrument.  
A single track can be assigned to all four instruments at once and there is no limit to how many tracks an individual instrument can have assigned to it. Your beatmap is then generated based on these assignments.  
If your MIDI file contains relevant keywords in its named tracks, we'll help you auto-assign them but you're always free to make more modifications as desired.  

**Track Assignment List** will display the tracks that you have assigned to different instruments.

## **Generate!**
After making sure all adjustments are correct, and you've assigned MIDI tracks to at least one instrument, click the "Generate!" button. Wait a moment and your beatmap will be ready!  
Please note that the beatmap generation mechanism has some randomness. Therefore, the generated beatmaps will have a certain degree of variation each time.

## **Edit**
After the beatmap is generated, you can select the instrument for which you have a completed beatmap, click the **Open Editor** button, and enter into editing mode to make more adjustments to this instrument's beatmap.
