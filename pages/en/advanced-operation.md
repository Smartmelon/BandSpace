# Advanced Editing

## **Number of Beats per bar**
The number of beats per bar (corresponding to the upper numeral of a time signature), this value changes the time sign count on the timeline and is displayed numerically in each bar.  

## **Beat breakdown**
The number of subdivided beat points per beat, you can see this as the average number of slices of a segment, this will change the density of the minimum beat point of a song (the granularity of the edit table), the larger the beat subscore allows you to write a more dense number of notes.  

## **Add a Bookmark**
Bookmarks can be used to mark key points on the beatmap, such as the beginning of a chorus, the beginning of an instrument's solo. Adding a bookmark makes it easier to find where you need the beatmap.  

You can move your mouse to the empty space between the edit grid and the page scroll bar. You will see an orange pen-like icon appear when you hover your mouse over it, then click to add a bookmark to the current position, type whatever you want to note down, and click on any blank area to save.  

If you want to change or remove an existing bookmark, find and click on the bookmark, type or delete and click on any space area to save.  

## **Batch selection**
In "Edit", you can select multiple notes by left-clicking on a bland space and dragging your mouse  over the notes, the selected notes will be highlighted in green. After at least one note has been selected, click the right mouse button to deselect them.  

### Batch copy
After selecting at least one note in the box, move the mouse to the position where the note can be added, left-click on a note cell again to copy all the selected notes, and note that your cursor point corresponds to the bottom-left-most note of all the notes selected (The bottom-left-most note will be pasted at your cursor point).  

### Batch deletion
After selecting at least one note in the box, use the keyboard's "Delete" key to delete all the notes selected.  

## **Autosave**
Accidentally closed the editor and forgot to save your changes? Don't worry, the editor has automatically saved the data every 2 minutes to prevent you from losing your dedicated work.
