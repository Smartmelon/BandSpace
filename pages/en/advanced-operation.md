## **Number of beats per beat**
The number of beats per bar (corresponding to the denominator of each song's time sign), this value changes the time sign count on the timeline and is displayed numerically in each bar.  

## **Beat breakdown**
The number of subdivided beat points per beat, you can see this as the average number of slices of a segment, this will change the density of the minimum beat point of a song (the granularity of the edit table), the larger the beat subscore allows you to write a more dense number of music notes.  

## **Add a Bookmark**
Bookmarks can be used to mark key points on the sheet, such as the beginning of a chorus, the beginning of an instrument's solo . Adding a bookmark makes it easier to find where you need the sheet.  

You can move your mouse to the empty space between the edit grid and the page scroll bar. You will see an orange pen-like icon appear when you hover over the mouse. Click the mouse to add a bookmark to the current position. Enter whatever you want to note and click the space to save.  

If you want to remove an existing bookmark, find and click on the bookmark, delete everything and click on the blank space.  

## **Batch selection**
In "Edit", you can select multiple music notes by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the mouse, and copy or delete the music notes in the box (the selected music notes will be highlighted in green) in batches. After at least one music note has been selected, click the right mouse button to uncheck the box.  

### Batch copy
After selecting at least one music note in the box, move the mouse to the position where the music note can be added, and click the left mouse button again to copy all the selected music notes (if multiple music notes are selected, the music note at the bottom and the leftmost will be copied to the selected position).  

### Batch deletion
After selecting at least one music note in the box, use the keyboard's "Delete" key to delete all selected music notes.  

## **Autosave**
