## Getting to know the UI 

Go to the folder you extracted Edda to, and open `Edda.exe`.  

This is what Edda's UI looks like.

![](assets/img/Edda1.png)

Let's have a closer look at the editing grid, since we'll be working with it a lot.

![](assets/img/Edda2.png)

The scan line is marked by four drums. This represents your current position in the song (consistent with the slider in the media controls). When you play back your map, it will start from the scan line. 

The editing grid contains many gridlines - these are where you'll be placing your notes.

The darker gridlines are called major gridlines. These gridlines represent the start of a beat in the song.

The space between the major gridlines are divided up into sub-beats by minor gridlines. 

For most of this grid, the beats (major gridlines) are divided into four sub-beats.  
We call this a *Beat Division* of 4 (or 1/4), which you can specify in the right sidebar.

The *Grid Spacing* is a multiplier that affects the space between gridlines.  
This can also be found in the right sidebar. The default value is 2, but you can increase this if the gridlines are too cramped, or lower it if you want to fit more of the map on the editing grid. 

## Creating a map

Click the "New Map" button in the toolbar.

Select a folder to store your map in. Ragnarock uses the directory `Documents/Ragnarock/CustomSongs`, so a good starting point is to create a folder in there and use it.

Select the `.ogg` Vorbis file you want to map.

Your map is now set up and ready to edit!

## Setting up song timing

### Finding the song BPM

Let's find out the BPM of our song.

Click the "BPM Finder" button at the top of Edda's main window.

Play the song in Edda, then bring up the BPM finder window and tap any key to the beat.

Once you feel that you've tapped enough beats, look at the average BPM displayed and put it in the *Song Tempo* under the left sidebar of the main window (you might want to round it to the nearest integer).

### Aligning the song

Edda assumes the start of the song file is the first beat, but most song files don't begin exactly on a beat.

There are two ways we can resolve this issue. 

The first is to trim the song file beforehand using something like Audacity or [Arrow Vortex](http://arrowvortex.ddrnl.com). This can be tedious to do.  

The second solution is to place a timing change at the start of the first beat in the song. This is a lot easier, so let's go through this.  

Move your mouse over the editing grid and press `Ctrl-T`. A purple marker will appear on the grid, which you can drag to align with the start of the song. Make sure the displayed BPM and beat divisions are correct; you can edit these by right-clicking them. Timing changes can be deleted with a middle-click.

You can snap a timing change to the grid by holding `Shift` while dragging or using `Ctrl-Shift-T`. This is useful when you only want to change the beat division and not the BPM.

> **NOTE**: You can view all timing changes at once and edit them by clicking the "Edit Song Timing" button in the right sidebar.

### Checking the song's timing

Your song should be ready to map now, but let's check that the timing is correct.

Turn on the *Metronome* feature in the right sidebar. Now play them back using the Play/Pause button in the media controls (or by pressing the spacebar).

Does the metronome sound like it's synchronised to the music?

Be sure to check both at the start *and* at the end of your song:

- If you've made an error placing the BPM change at the start of your song, it will become obvious there.

- If you've made an error specifying the *Song Tempo*, it will be easiest to find out at the end of the song - that's where all the BPM errors will accumulate.

Make sure your timing is as close to perfect as possible before you move on - you don't want to come back after placing thousands of notes to find that there's a mistake with the timing.  

> **NOTE**: If you are having audio sync issues, check out the page on [Audio Latency](advanced-topics#audio-latency).

## Setting up map info

Before we start placing notes, we need to fill out some details about our map.

### Map Settings and metadata

In the left sidebar under **Map Settings**, fill out the *Song Name*, *Artist Name* and *Mapper Name*.   

Choose an *Environment* for your song - this is the world your ship will row in when you play the song in-game.  

Under **File Info**, click the button with a folder icon next to the *Image* field. Choose a cover image for your map - this will be displayed in-game.  

> **NOTE**: If you want to change the song file in your map, select the button with a folder icon next to *Song File*, under **File Info**.

### Song Preview (optional)

The preview is what plays in-game when you select a song. It should be shorter than 15 seconds and it should showcase the best part of your song, for example the chorus.

You don't need a preview for your song to be playable, but it's a good idea to have one.  

Using the media controls in the bottom of Edda's main window, pick out the start and end times of what you want the preview to be.

Under **File Info**, click the "Create Song Preview" button. Put in your start and end times, add a fade in and fade out duration (if you wish) and then click "Create Preview". You can find the finished result in your map folder with the filename `preview.ogg`.

### Bookmarks

#### The navigational waveform

Let's take a look at the navigational waveform next to the editor grid.

The waveform of the entire song is displayed here, and the dark blue horizontal line indicates the position of the scan line (the current position). 

You can scrub through the song by clicking on or dragging across the waveform.

The navigational waveform is a useful high-level overview of the whole song, and it's where our bookmarks will go.

#### Managing bookmarks

Bookmarks are there to mark out important points in the song - for example, the start of a verse or chorus. Having bookmarks in a song makes it much easier to navigate.

You can create a new bookmark by positioning your mouse where you want the bookmark to go and pressing Ctrl-B.

You can mouse over either the editor grid (for more accuracy) or the navigational waveform. 

Clicking on a bookmark in the navigational waveform will let you jump to that location in the map.

To rename a bookmark, right-click it.

To delete a bookmark, middle-click it.

> **NOTE**: Edda's bookmarks are fully compatible with MMA2's bookmarks.

### Difficulty Settings

The **Difficulty Settings** are located in the right sidebar.

Ragnarock maps come with up to three difficulties, indicated by 1-3 stacked triangles (more triangles means higher relative difficulty).

You can add or delete difficulties using the "+" and "-" buttons.  

You can switch to another difficulty by clicking on the large buttons with icons in them. The button that is disabled (greyed out) is the difficulty you have currently selected.  

You don't have to worry about rearranging your difficulties - Edda will sort them for you.

___

Each difficulty has a *Difficulty Level*, *Note Speed*, and **Medal Distances**.

The *Difficulty Level* is a number from 1 to 10 (inclusive) that represents how hard the map is. You should be familiar with this number if you've played Ragnarock before.

The *Note Speed* is how fast the runes approach you when you play the map in-game. You'll have to experiment with this in the game to get a feel for what the numbers mean. A good place to start is 15, which represents an average speed. You can increase this a few units to make the notes approach even faster.

**Medal Distances** represent how many metres your boat must row in order to achieve a certain medal. In most cases, you should leave these set to "Auto" so that Ragnarock will automatically calculate medal distances for you.  

## Mapping Notes

Now that everything else is set up, let's start placing notes.

While you map, it might be helpful to refer to the *Grid Waveform*.

### Basic controls

The editing grid is where you'll be placing notes.

To add a note on the grid, just left-click where you want the note to go.

> **NOTE**: You can also use the `1`, `2`, `3` and `4` keys to add notes. Unlike mouse controls, you can add notes in this way while the song is playing (the notes will be added on the scanline instead of on your mouse position).

By default, Edda will snap your placed notes to the gridlines. If you don't want this behaviour (for example, if you want to place arpeggiated notes), you can disable it by toggling the *Snap to Grid* checkbox in the right sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl-G`.

To remove a note, simply right-click it.

### Selecting notes

You can select notes by either clicking them individually or dragging across the editing grid (to select multiple notes).

If you hold down the `Shift` key while selecting, you can add to your selection instead of clearing it.

Pressing `Ctrl-A` will select every note on the map.

Pressing the `Escape` key will clear your selection.

Edda provides several ways to manipulate note selections:

- Cut (`Ctrl-X`), copy (`Ctrl-C`) and paste (`Ctrl-V`) are supported.
- The `Delete` key will remove all selected notes.
- You can use `Ctrl-M` to mirror the notes.
- You can move notes one column to the left/right by using `Shift+Left` or `Shift-Right`.
- You can move notes one gridline forward/backward by using `Shift+Up` or `Shift-Down`.
- You can move notes one beat forward/backward by using `Ctrl+Up` or `Ctrl-Down`.

Edda also supports undoing (`Ctrl-Z`) and redoing (`Ctrl-Y` or `Ctrl-Shift-Z`) of these operations.

### Note playback

Once you've placed some notes, you should play back the map to see how it sounds.

You can use the media controls to do so, or press `Space` to play/pause the song.

It may be helpful to adjust the *Song Volume* and *Note Volume* in the right sidebar to help you hear notes properly.

### Exporting your map

Once you're done with mapping, you can press the "Export Map" button, and Edda will create a .zip file for you that can be uploaded to [Ragnacustoms](https://ragnacustoms.com).  

Backups made by Edda will not be copied over into the .zip file.
