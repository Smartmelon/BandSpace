# Getting Started
Want to design your own superstring sheet music? Let's prepare the following first.

## **A computer**
To run Superstring Editor, you need a computer with Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## **Install the software**
At present, it is only supported to download the Superstring Editor through Steam . You need to get and install the game Superstring on Steam first. When launching the game, select Launch Editor.  

## **Songs used to make scores**
### Choose a suitable song
Great music is essential to a great score. In theory, any song you like can be used to design a score. But Superstring is a VR game with musical instruments, so for a good play experience, it is recommended that you use songs with at least one instrument that stands out from your hearing.  

### Get song files
Once you have identified the song, you need to provide a suitable audio file and import it into the editor.   
The Superstring Editor requires song files to be in Vorbis format. The file extension for Vorbis format appears as .ogg.    
If you can't find the .ogg file, you can also easily convert audio files in other formats (such as .wav or .mp3) to .ogg files. There are plenty of software that can do this, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [FormatFactory](http://www.pcgeshi.com/index.html)ã€‚

If you've already started the Superstring Editor and have your audio files ready, then follow the [Getting Started](using-mapping) and design the sheet for free.
