# Prep Work 
Want to design your own superstring sheet music? Let's prepare the following first.

## **A computer**
To run Band Space Beatmap Editor, you need a computer with Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## **Install the software**
Please click the "Download" button above, or [ClickHere]（https://github.com/Smartmelon/BandSpace/releases)，to the download page.

## **Songs**
### Choose a suitable song
Great music is essential to a great score. In theory, any song you like can be used to design a score. But Superstring is a VR game with musical instruments, so for a good play experience, it is recommended that you use songs with at least one instrument that stands out from your hearing.  

### Get song files
Once you have chosen the song, you need to have the right audio file to import it into the editor.  
The Band Space Editor requires song files to be in Vorbis format. The file extension for Vorbis format is ".ogg".  
If you can't find the OGG file, you can also easily convert audio files in other formats (such as WAV or MP3) to OGG files. There is plenty of software that can do this, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [FormatFactory](http://www.pcgeshi.com/index.html)。

If you've already launched the Band Space Editor and have your audio files ready, then follow the [Basic Instructions](using-mapping) instructions before you can design the beatmap freely.
