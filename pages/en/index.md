# About

## **What is this software?**
BandSpace Editor is the official beatmap editor for the VR rhythm game **BandSpace**, which you can find in [Meta](https://www.meta.com/experiences/band-space/26019802470968635/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2182070).  

With this editor, you can design beatmaps for your favorite songs, and upload them to share on the [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/bandspace) community, allowing all players to play your designed map. 

Want to start making a custom map of yours? Head over to [Before Mapping](before-mapping) to prepare audio files that you want to make a map of.  

If you've prepared an audio file already, then follow our walkthrough on the [Mapping Instruction](mapping-instruction) page next.  

Or find a MIDI file that matches with your audio on internet. Our [MIDI to Beatmap](midi-to-beatmap) feature will generate beatmaps based off it automatically for you.  

By simply placing the custom beatmaps in the specified game path refer to [Play Custom Map](play-custom-map) and enjoy them in-game!
