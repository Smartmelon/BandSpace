## System requirements

To run Edda, you'll need a computer with Windows 10 or Windows 11.  

> **NOTE**: If you have a Linux or macOS computer, you may be able to use software like [WINE](https://www.winehq.org) or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) to run Windows programs.  
>
> Older versions of Windows (up to Windows 7) may work, but are not officially supported.

## Installation

Start by going to the GitHub repository's [Releases section](https://github.com/PKBeam/Edda/releases). There will be two `.zip` packages for you to download. 

Most users should download the larger package - the one that is **not** named `NoRuntime`.  
If you are unsure, download this one.
  
If you have the [.NET 6.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) installed, then you can use the smaller `NoRuntime` zip package.

> **NOTE**: For versions of Edda before v1.0.0, you must use the [.NET 5.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) instead.

Once you've downloaded the zip package, extract it somewhere on your PC.

Make sure your antivirus doesn't interfere with anything, and that you don't extract Edda into a privileged folder (such as `Program Files`).
  
## Setting up your song
### Choosing a good song
Every map needs a good track, so before we start placing notes we need to pick a good song.  

Ragnarock is designed for metal genres but works great with many kinds of loud, energetic songs.  

Be careful when mapping quiet songs, such as background music or "chill" songs - they may not work as well as you expect.

### Getting a song file
Once you've settled on a song, you need to get an appropriate file to use for mapping.  

Edda requires the song file to be in Vorbis format. Files with the Vorbis format are characterised by a `.ogg` file extension.  

> **NOTE**: Some `.ogg` files may rarely use the Opus codec, which is not supported by Edda.  
> If you have `ffmpeg` installed, you can quickly check the codec by using `ffmpeg -i input.ogg` and reading the output.

If you can't find an `.ogg` file, you'll have to make one yourself by converting from an audio file with a different format (such as `.wav` or `.mp3`).  

There are plenty of applications that can do this:
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) is a popular user-friendly tool.  
- If you know how to use command-line tools, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) will do the job faster.   

> **NOTE**: If you use a music streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music, you can play the song you want on your computer and record it to a file. 
> You can do this in Audacity by setting your microphone input to your headphone/speaker output and starting a recording with the song playing.

#### Lossless encoding

If possible, you should obtain a lossless audio file (e.g. `.wav` or `.flac`) and transcode it into Vorbis format (`.ogg`).

You should aim for a quality preset somewhere from 5 to 9.

The quality 10 preset produces unnecessarily large files, and anything under quality 5 may sound noticeably poor. For reference, Spotify Premium uses quality 9.

You can set the quality
- in Audacity, by using the slider in the file save dialog (after you click "Export to OGG").
- in ffmpeg, by using the `-q` flag, e.g. `ffmpeg -i input.wav -q 9 out.ogg`.

#### Lossy encoding
If you can't get a lossless file, you may have to make do with a lossy file (e.g. `.mp3`).  

The easiest way to get one is via YouTube. There are plenty of websites that will take a YouTube link and turn it into an `.mp3` file for you.

You can then transcode to Vorbis format by using Audacity or ffmpeg as described above in [Lossless encoding](#lossless-encoding).

> **NOTE**: If possible, you should aim to get lossless files. Lossy files and in particular lossy-to-lossy transcoding will result in worse sound quality.  
> If you can't find a lossless file, don't worry. It will be hard for most players to tell the difference, especially with Ragnarock's drum sounds playing over the music.

Now that you have Edda installed and an audio file ready to go, head on over to [Using Edda](using-edda) to start making your map!
